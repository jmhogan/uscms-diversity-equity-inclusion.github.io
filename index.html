<h1 id="mission">Mission</h1>
<p>The U.S. CMS Collaboration is committed to empowering its members to develop and achieve their full
potential as excellent and innovative particle physicists. The Collaboration acknowledges that diversity,
equity, and inclusion (DEI) are fundamental values that impact all aspects of work by the members of
our community, within HEP and within the wider field of physics. Our vision for diversity is that the
U.S. CMS Collaboration, in all of its aspects (including research, operations, and projects), has a working
environment where all members of the Collaboration can thrive and bring in their talents, irrespective of
their dissimilar characteristics. The U.S. CMS working climate is positive, respectful, and supportive of
all.</p>
